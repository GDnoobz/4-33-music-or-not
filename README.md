Hey everyone! My answer was so long that I decided that it would be best to just put my answer in a word file and allow everyone that wants to read my answer to just download the file and read it. So that's what this is. To downlaod the file, click the green button in the top right that says "Code". Then, in the meny that shows up, click "Download ZIP." That will download a zip file, which you can then extract to get a pdf and this file. You can then open the pdf to see my answer. There is also an odt file if you would like to edit my answer. That's all! Have fun!
